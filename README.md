# ML-Coursera

This repository contains all the programming exercises in **Python** for the Coursera course called "Machine Learning" by 
Adjunct Professor Andrew Ng at Stanford University.  

+ Written in Python3 using Jupyter Notebook.
+ Explains the derivations in detail.
+ Discusses few topics (not covered in course)in detail.
+ Mainly uses pandas and numpy library.
+ Zero use of sklearn and like libraries.

Course : [Machine Learning (Stanford University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
